    "1. Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. In other words, it should have only one job. Example: minimax\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open-Closed Principle: Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. That means you should be able to add new functionality to an object without altering its existing code.\n",
    "    + Example: [Load multiple types and subtypes of resources](https://github.com/xinzhel/word_corruption/blob/main/resource.py)\n",

    "3. Liskov Substitution Principle\n",
    "    + Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. If B is a subtype of A, then wherever A is expected, B can be used without any issue. \n",
