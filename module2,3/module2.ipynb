    "## Design Principles\n",
    "* [ The use of Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in Python and the concept of metaclasses](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/two-types-of-abstractions-in-python-instance-of-inherited-from-e436a63cfcfd) can reflect all the three principles\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- 1. Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. In other words, it should have only one job. Example: minimax -->\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open-Closed Principle: Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. That means you should be able to add new functionality to an object without altering its existing code.\n",
    "    + Example: [Load multiple types and subtypes of resources](https://github.com/xinzhel/word_corruption/blob/main/resource.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Liskov Substitution Principle\n",
    "    + Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. If B is a subtype of A, then wherever A is expected, B can be used without any issue. \n",
    "    + More related to polymorphism\n",
    "    + Less related to inheritance, especially in dynamic typing languages like Python due to duck typing.\n"

    "2. Facade\n",
    "    + In Huggingface Transformers, the pipeline function can be viewed as somewhat of a facade. It provides a high-level, easy-to-use API for performing tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, etc. with just a few lines of code. Underneath, it abstracts away the complexity of model loading, tokenization, and inference.\n",
