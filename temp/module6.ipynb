    "   * All unexplored vertices have longer distances than explored ones.\n",
    "   * The 1st path in the path queue must be the shortest path to the end of that path from S to the vertex, because 1) all the other paths in the path queue are longer than this path, hence no shorter walkaround. 2) all other paths to be included in the path queue are longer than this path, since they must be longer than all the paths in the current path queue.\n",
    "   * Other path in the path queue may not be the shortest path to the end of that path from S\n",
    "   * To find the path at the end, we should use linked list for each vertex.\n",

    "1. Have a look at the associated ipython notebook and run the code for Dijkstra. Demonstrate your understanding of the code by:\n",
    "   Running the code with many different test-cases.\n",
    "   Modify the code to output the nodes in the shortest path instead of just the cost of the shortest path.\n",
    "2. Modify Dijkstra's Algorithm in this week's lab to do a Bellman-Ford instead.\n",
    "   Test case where BF handles negative cycles in the graph.\n",
    "   Clearly differentiate the working of two algorithms.\n",
    "3. Have a look at the following Python's implementation of heap (priority Queues): HeapDict, and try to convert our Dijkstra's implementation to use this heap data structure instead.\n",
    "4. Write a brief report comparing 'Dynamic Programming' with 'Divide-and-Conquer' strategy? (If you are not familiar with Divide-and-Conquer strategy - revisit Quick Sort or Binary Search algorithms. You should address why we can not use DP for Quick Sort or Binary Sort)\n",
    "5. You are running up a staircase with a total of n steps. You can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at at time. Write a DP program to determine how many possible ways you can run up the stairs? (Hint: Start with a recursive solution, and then later move to top-down approach of DP).\n",
    "6. Write down the algorithm for Floyd-Warshall, and implement this in this weeks' lab notebook.\n",
